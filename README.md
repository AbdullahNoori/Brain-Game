# Brain-Game
Final project - Brain Games
Description
With your knowledge about Swift and iOS, your goal for this project will be to build a functional app. This should be a learning experience and a challenge to prove how far you've come during this course.

You will be building a Brain Training app! üß†üí™üèº
Training our brains is a great way to keep our minds active, improve our memory and attention. To read more about how research supports this, I encourage you to read this article.

The game required for this project is a Color Matching game üåà
Users are shown words of colors (one below the other) and need to identify if the text in the upper word matches the color of the word at the bottom.
This is usually an exercise to demonstrate the Stroop Effect. And one of its goals is to help with reaction time.

An example of implementation here.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able to‚Ä¶

Demonstrate proficiency using Swift's basic building blocks.
Follow a set of requirements to build a product.
Build an app with Xcode that users can interact with.
Run the final version of the app in a real device.
Schedule
From the day this project is assigned, you will have 3 weeks to complete this project. A sample daily outline is provided to assist you in planning your project.

Important note: ‚ÄúWeek 1‚Äù refers to the first calendar week of the project being assigned, and subsequent weeks will follow this reference:

Week 1: Project assigned, read the project spec, ask any clarifying questions you may have, design how you would implement the project and start the basic UI
Week 2: Build out main functionality (game mechanics) and hook up UI
Week 3: Testing, fix any remaining bugs, make sure your code has helpful comments, and submit the project!
Requirements
Users are shown two words with the name of a color (words are colored).
Users are asked if the text of first word matches the color in the second word.
Users select an answer: yes or no.
Users get 10 points if they are correct, they get 10 points less if they're wrong.
Users can see a score in the screen.
Users go on for 60 seconds before the game ends.
Users can restart the game.
You can either use SpriteKit or UIKit for the project. (UIKit is advised)
Use Swift's basic building blocks
variables & constants
custom types (classes, structs or enums)
functions
control flow
Version control with Github
